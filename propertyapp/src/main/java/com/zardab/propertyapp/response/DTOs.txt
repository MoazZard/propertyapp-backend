Example of a DTO in Java (Data Transfer Object)
Imagine an application with a User entity, but we don't want to expose all
the details about the user (like password or creation date) when sending data to the frontend.
(Some data is redundant to the frontend)


Entity (Business Model):

@Entity
public class User {
    private Long id;
    private String username;
    private String email;
    private String password;
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;

    // Getters and Setters
}


DTO (Data Transfer Object):

public class UserDTO {
    private Long id;
    private String username;
    private String email;

    // Constructor, Getters, and Setters
}
